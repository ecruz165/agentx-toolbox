# Gittyup — Overview

Gittyup is a multi-repo orchestration CLI that manages branch flow across groups of git repositories. It handles merges, cherry-picks, conflict resolution, and PR creation across an entire fleet of repos from a single command.

## What It Does

Teams working across multiple repositories face a recurring problem: promoting changes from `dev` to `staging` to `prod` across 5, 10, or 50 repos is tedious and error-prone. Gittyup solves this by:

- **Grouping repos** into logical sets (frontend, backend, services)
- **Branch aliasing** — `dev`, `staging`, `prod` map to actual branch names per repo
- **Batch operations** — merge or cherry-pick across an entire group in one command
- **Conflict resolution** — interactive UI with AI-assisted resolution (Copilot, Anthropic, OpenAI)
- **PR automation** — create PRs across repos after operations
- **Dashboard** — see branch state, drift, and conflicts at a glance

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize (inside a git repo for project-local config, or globally)
agentx-gittyup init

# Discover and add repos
agentx-gittyup find ~/projects

# Check the state of all repos
agentx-gittyup status --fetch

# Compare branches before merging
agentx-gittyup compare dev staging

# Merge dev into staging across a group
agentx-gittyup merge dev staging --group frontend --push --pr
```

## Configuration

Gittyup is driven by a `gittyup.yaml` manifest that defines repo groups, branch mappings, and settings.

**Config discovery order:**
1. Repo-local: `<git-root>/.agentx/gittyup/gittyup.yaml`
2. Walk-up: bare `gittyup.yaml` in any parent directory
3. Global: `~/.agentx/gittyup/gittyup.yaml`

**Example manifest:**

```yaml
workspace: .
groups:
  frontend:
    description: UI applications
    repos:
      - name: web-app
        path: ./packages/web-app
        remote: origin
        url: https://github.com/org/web-app.git
        branches:
          dev: develop
          staging: staging
          prod: main
        tags: [ui, react]
  backend:
    repos:
      - name: api
        path: ./services/api
        branches: { dev: develop, staging: staging, prod: main }
        tags: [api, node]
settings:
  ai_mode: suggest
  github:
    token_env: GITHUB_TOKEN
  pr_template: |
    ## {{operation}} from `{{source_branch}}` to `{{target_branch}}`
    **Repo:** {{repo_name}}
```

## Commands

| Command | Alias | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `init` | | Initialize a workspace (project-local or global) |
| `find <dir>` | | Discover git repos and add them interactively |
| `repo add/remove/list/tag` | | Manage repos and groups |
| `group create/remove` | | Manage groups |
| `status` | `dash` | Dashboard — branch states across all repos |
| `fetch` | | Fetch all remotes |
| `compare <left> <right>` | `cmp` | Compare branches with conflict detection |
| `merge <source> <target>` | | Merge a branch across repos |
| `pick` | `cherry-pick` | Cherry-pick commits between branches |
| `prs` | | List open PRs across repos |
| `auth login/status/logout/models` | | Manage AI provider authentication |
| `config` | | View and update settings |
| `cache clear/prune` | | Manage result cache |

## AI Integration

Gittyup uses AI for conflict resolution during merges and cherry-picks. Three providers are supported:

- **GitHub Copilot** — OAuth device flow, uses Copilot chat completions API
- **Anthropic** — OAuth PKCE flow (or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var), Claude models
- **OpenAI** — OAuth PKCE flow with localhost redirect (or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var), GPT models

The `auth login` CLI command currently wires up GitHub Copilot authentication. Anthropic and OpenAI providers are implemented and can authenticate programmatically, but their login flows are not yet exposed through the CLI command.

AI modes:
- `auto` — automatically resolve conflicts using AI
- `suggest` — show AI suggestion, user decides
- `manual` — open editor for manual resolution

## AI Tool Context

Gittyup ships bundled context files for AI coding tools. During `init`, you can install:

- **Claude Code** — agents to `.claude/agents/`, commands to `.claude/commands/ax/gittyup/`
- **GitHub Copilot** — instructions to `.github/instructions/`, prompts to `.github/prompts/`
- **OpenAI Codex** — combined `AGENTS.md` at project root

These give AI agents awareness of gittyup commands and workflows.

## Part of AgentX

Gittyup belongs to the **agentx** suite. Config lives under `~/.agentx/gittyup/` (or per-repo at `<repo>/.agentx/gittyup/`). The `AGENTX_HOME` environment variable can override the config root.

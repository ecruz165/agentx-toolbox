/**
 * LLMProvider data model — the registry record for a model provider.
 *
 * Per project memory `project_per_worker_model_subscription`: every model
 * usable from the harness is served by some provider. A provider has two
 * facets:
 *   1. authMethods — how a deployment can authenticate against this provider
 *   2. models      — which models this provider can serve once authenticated
 *
 * Agents declare an `accepts: <provider>:<model>[]` priority list in their
 * catalog spec; the broker walks the list and returns the first satisfiable
 * binding. Resolution lives in a follow-up commit; this file is just the
 * data shapes.
 *
 * v1 registry is hardcoded (provider-registry.ts). Loading from JSON to
 * support custom-hosted endpoints (vLLM etc.) is a future widening that
 * would relax `Provider` from a closed union to `string`.
